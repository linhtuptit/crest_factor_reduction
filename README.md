# crest_factor_reduction
This is an algorithm used to reduce the PAPR (Peak To Average Power Ratio) of the transmitted signals so that the power amplifier can operate more efficiently. In this project, THREE algorithms of Crest Factor Reduction technique are presented consisting of: Hard Clipper (HC-CFR), Peak Windowing (PW-CFR) and Peak Cancellation (PC-CFR)
1. Hard Clipper technique
![\Large x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a})
2. Peak Windowing technique
3. Peak Cancellation technique
